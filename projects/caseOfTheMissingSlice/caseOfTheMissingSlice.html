      <b>A Dream In Whipped Cream: The Case Of The Missing Slice</b> is a video game, produced as a final for a Computational Approaches To Narrative course at NYU ITP.
  <br><br>
Computational Approaches to Narrative considers how narrative structure can be represented as data and enacted through computation, and invites students to implement practical prototypes of their own interactive and procedurally-generated narratives using a variety of technologies. I used Bitsy, an online editor for small games and worlds. In conjuction with Bitsy, I used hacks Pixsy and Borksy.
  <br><br>
Clara Fernández-Vera, a game scholar, discusses environmental and indexical storytelling and the evocation of micro-narratives. I set the game in a model of the Park Slope apartment I was living in to capture a portrait of the space. Fernández-Vera states indexical storytelling is like “whodunnit” stories  “which points to something that happened or is going on, inviting the player to reconstruct what happened”. This, along with persistent breadcrumbs, encourage play.
  <br><br>
In The Case Of The Missing Slice, you begin in a dream state. You dream of tasting a delicious pie. Once you wake up, you explore the apartment as you make your way to the kitchen for your slice of pie. But alas, the plate is empty. As you search for clues youget to solve the mystery of the missing slice. You may learn that your dream, in fact, was real life!
